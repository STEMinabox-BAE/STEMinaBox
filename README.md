# STEM In A Box :: Read Me!

Welcome to the STEM In A Box software setup guide! This will walk you through how to set up each box with all the necessary software. The code you need can be found inside the Source folder, organised into three different levels of challenge.

## Videos about the BBC Micro:bit (Optional)

Here are a couple of videos you can choose to watch if you'd like to learn a little bit more about the BBC Micro:bit and some of the things it can do:

**Long explaination**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6vp6nYDs9I

**Short explaination**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG7XiRU1wmQ

## Receiver (Source)

The Receiver Micro:bit is the device you will connect to the bus your team is assembling. However, this device requires some work before it can control the bus, which means you need to program and flash the Micro:bit with the code it requires.

Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Source** folder above
2. Choose your challenge level (_Easy_, _Medium_ or _Hard_), this will determine which file you should select
3. Click on the file named **`Receiver(DIFFICULTY).hex`**, where difficulty is the level of challenge you've chosen
4. Click the **"Download raw file"** button, on the top right of the code area

5. The file will appear inside the **Downloads** folder of the Chromebook **Files** app
6. Go to the **Microbit Python Editor (https://python.microbit.org/v/3)**
7. Click the **"Open..."** button

8. Select the **`Receiver(DIFFICULTY).hex`** file inside the same **Downloads** folder as found earlier in Step 5

**Note**

The file may be in the form **`Receiver.hex.txt`** in which case you will need to **rename** the file and **remove** the **`.txt`** extension. It will warn you that the file may not work, click **"OK"**.

- Select the **`Receiver.hex`** file to open in the Micro:bit code editor
- Follow the instructions that look like this with a hashtag symbol (could be before code or on the same line as it):

- Enjoy!

## Transmitter

The Transmitter Micro:bit is inside the controller, and already has all the necessary code to run properly. The code is contained in this repository for you to explore if you wish.

1. Navigate to the **Transmitter** folder above
2. Click on the file named **`Transmitter.hex`**
3. Follow **Steps 4 to 8** for the **Receiver** file to open and explore the file in the Microbit Editor
