## Receiver
The Receiver Micro:bit is inside the bus. This is the device that requires programming to work. Go to https://python.microbit.org/v/3

## Transmitter
The Transmitter Micro:bit is inside the controller, and already has all the necessary code to run properly. The code is contained in this repository for you to explore if you wish.
